they are thinking that lots of dynamite left means use lots of dynamite
---> potential tactic: use less dynamite at the start
        SERIES OF PLAY:
        p1 saves dynamite
        p2 thinks high chance of dynamite so uses up lots of water
        p1 able to win as p2 using less dynamite
        ????

---> potential tactic 2: use up all of you dynamite and then play water while the opposition uses up theirs
        SERIES OF PLAY:
        p1 uses all dynamite quickly
        p2 sees this so thinks safe to use dynamite
        as soon as p1 finishes dynamite p1 plays water

        STEPS:
        geoBot:
            tests whether p2 dynamite is very low
            if p2 dynamite is very low then uses all its own dynamite
        extremeBot:
            if its own dynamite is very low and opponents dynamite is high
            uses lots of water
            (extension: check that geobot is behaving as expected else abort)
